### Personal Interests

I enjoy watching and playing just about every sport you can name. I am remarkably average at most of them. I like to pretend that I have refined tastes in television shows, movies, craft beer, and classical music, but I really do not. Anyone could call me out on this and immediately deduce that I am a fraud when it comes to these things.
