### Interests

I enjoy watching and playing just about every sport you can name. I am remarkably average at some of them. I like to pretend that I have refined tastes in television shows, movies, craft beer, and classical music, but I really do not. Anyone could call me out on this and immediately deduce that I am a fraud when it comes to these things.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("schertz-basketball.jpg")
```

The following are some of my favorite childhood pictures (and no, I cannot tell the difference between [Tony](https://tonyelhabr.rbind.io/about.html) and me):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("baby-halloween.jpg", "schertz-twins.jpg", "lebanon-twins-1.jpg",
                          "lebanon-twins-2.jpg", "child-camel.jpg", "baby-texas.jpg"))
```
