### About Me

I am a graduating Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research in the [H. Milton Stewart Schoool of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) working with [Turgay Ayer](https://sites.gatech.edu/turgay-ayer/). I have a breadth of research experience in healthcare topics such as pharmaceutical pricing, advanced diagnostic imaging, stroke and trauma outcomes, and telehealth. I have experience working with healthcare data in most of these areas, including using SQL/SAS to query large administrative claims databases and primarily R for data visualization, statistical and prediction modeling, and machine learning with reduced data sets.

I am currently looking for a data analyst/scientist role in the healthcare space.
