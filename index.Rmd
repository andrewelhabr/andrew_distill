### About Me

My name is Andrew ElHabr, and I am a graduating Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I have a breadth of research experience in healthcare topics such as pharmaceutical pricing, advanced diagnostic imaging, stroke and trauma outcomes, and telehealth. I have experience working with healthcare data in most of these areas, including using SQL/SAS to query large administrative claims databases and primarily R for data visualization, statistical and prediction modeling, and machine learning with reduced data sets. *I am currently looking for a data science/analyst role in the healthcare space.*
